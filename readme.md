Welcome to Mobildeal.se!

This application allows users to compare phone plans and find the best deal for their needs. The application uses a REST API written in Node.js to retrieve data about the different phone plans from a MongoDB database. Users can sort the plans by different criteria, such as price, data allowance, and contract length.

To get started, simply visit the home page and browse the available phone plans. You can sort the plans using the sort menu located at the top of the page.
